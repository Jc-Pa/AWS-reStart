Python files for AWS reStart - Cloud Practitioner Certification Program - Fundaci√≥n Altius/Madrid

These are my files made during my time on AWS Could practitioner certification program in Madrid
Most of my notes are in Spanish
This is not a Guide but my space to comprehend and learn more about python while doing the cloud certification
With in time I may come with more profound notes but due to work and life it self many of this won't be completed more than the resolution to the lab it self
