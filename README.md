Python files for AWS reStart - Cloud Practitioner Certification Program - Fundaci√≥n Altius/Madrid

These are my files made during my time on AWS Could practitioner certification program in Madrid
Most of my notes are in Spanish
This is not a Guide but my space to comprehend and learn more about python while doing the cloud certification
With in time I may come with more profound notes but due to work and life it self many of this won't be completed more than the resolution to the lab it self
However if you find it useful, you can take and use whatever you need from the files here to follow your own journey in this field.
